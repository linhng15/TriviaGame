# TriviaGame
This is a Trivia game using Javascript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. 
<br>
The theme is Monopoly and it's for my 8 years old brother. (For each question, I gave him 120 sec.)
<br>
 A trivia game that shows only one question at a time until the player answers it or their time runs out.
<br>
The final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, unanswered question and an option to restart the game.
